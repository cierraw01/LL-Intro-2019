The task is to provide the code necessary to execute the test cases as given in main().  Look for comment sections 'Your code here'

The Linked List will be a simple list with unique integer values generated for each added node.

The resulting program should successfully implement;
void add(int data);   // add the provided data element to the list
void remove(int data);    // remove the node containing 'data'
int sum();  // calculate the sum of the data in all the nodes of the list.

When complete, post the source code and runtime output on BLEND.
